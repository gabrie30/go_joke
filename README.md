## joke

> guaranteed to make your day better, or your money back!

## use

```bash
# installs joke in your $HOME/go/bin, make sure this is in you $PATH
$ go get github.com/gabrie30/joke
# sets up the sqlite database in $HOME/joke.db
$ joke db setup
# tell one joke
$ joke
# tell many jokes
$ joke --count=2
# get help
$ joke --help
```

> for best results add `joke` to .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.  :trollface:

## datastore

> Sqlite uses the file $HOME/joke.db that is created on your behalf after running `joke db setup`. The database is only updated the first time you run the `joke` command, for that day. This is to increase performance.

## troubleshooting

- Make sure `$HOME/go/bin` is in your $PATH `go env | grep GOBIN` if not, you need to set it
